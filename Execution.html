        <p>Finalizing your gameplay, clue system, and introduction are crucial steps in completing your escape room experience. One of the best ways to ensure everything runs smoothly is through <strong>beta testing</strong>!</p>

        <p><strong>Invite friends and family</strong> to play your game before its official launch. This will help you identify any issues and ensure that your game master can effectively support players as needed. Here are some important questions to consider:</p>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>
                <strong>How long should it take to solve each puzzle?</strong>
                <p>Puzzles vary in complexity. Some can be solved in just a minute or two, while others may require up to 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What kind of assistance can I provide without giving away the solution?</strong>
                <p>Offering a range of helpful clues can guide players without diminishing their sense of achievement. Aim to strike a balance between providing support and allowing them to feel the thrill of discovery.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How will players receive these clues?</strong>
                <p>In our early days, our clue system was straightforward: we would slide a piece of paper with hints under the door when requested.</p>
                <p>Now, we use an advanced program called <strong><a href="https://www.mythricmysterymaster.com/">Mythric Mystery Master (M3)</a></strong>. This tool allows us to design and manage the game digitally. With M3, we can track gameplay progress through a timer and completion percentage, making it easy to provide clues directly to players. Simply pull up the timer on the gameâ€™s television to communicate effectively.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>How will we train our staff?</strong>
                <p>Create a detailed gameplay sheet that outlines all puzzles, their solutions, and the steps leading players to the conclusion of the game. This sheet should also include the introduction for players before they embark on their adventure.</p>
